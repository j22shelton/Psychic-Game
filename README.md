# Psychic-Game
This is a game of "Man vs Machine"!

Essentially, the app randomly picks a letter, and the user must use their psychic skills to guess which letter the app chose. 

Points are accrued by guessing correctly
If the player wins, he gains a point on the Win Counter and the game starts over
If the player loses, the Losses counter gains a point and the game restarts without a page refresh
